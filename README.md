# Swift-MVP-Project
This project uses MVP Structure to create a java android project.

This Project uses different frameworks such as JSONParser and Firebase

This project shows the use of noSql Firebase Firestore Database, Firebase Hosting, Firebase Authentication, Firebase Storeage, Firebase Crashyltics, and Rest Api Requests to get data from Database.

I have created a web site that adds data to the Firebase DataBase. It is in another repository called HTML-CSS-JS-upload- data-to-DB-through-web.

The backend rest api was created with node. And can be found in the repository called Node.js-GetData-from-Firestore.

In order to use this app you will need the google.json file. Otherwise you will not be able to login to the app.
